# Project-Siera (The game I've been trying to make for a few years now.)

## Attempt number six

Learned that I'm good at killing my own motivation to do things by over amplifying the importance of what I'm doing. Being a details kind of worker, and not the bigger picture worker, it's important that I chunk projects into smaller projects and into smaller tasks. This is an excercise in just that.

This will become a full fledged game in the future, but one step at a time, ey?

## Achieving 'Tech Demo Status'

### Phase 1: The bones
1. The database server exists
2. The server can respond to requests
3. The server stores player characters
4. The server stores player characters and validates them
5. The server can modify player character attributes
6. The client can't modify anything on existing characters, only request new characters

### Phase 2: The meat
1. Player characters are given stats and attributes which will affect character's performance
2. Characters can target characters with attacks
3. Character actions are logged and preserved for viewing
4. Characters take damage
5. Characters take damage based on each other's stats and attributes
6. Characters can't attack repeatedly (attack mashing)
7. A turn based system exists to an extent
8. Characters take turns properly

### Phase 3: The brain
1. Players can chat and emote
2. Characters can't be controlled by another client controlling another character.
3. Character attack types are stored as a database entry
4. Character attack types have a 'wind up' and 'recovery'
5. Some attack types will cost a resource (like mana or stamina)
6. Characters can defend against attacks deliberately somehow
7. Combat will favor the attacker somewhat, but defender won't be helpless

### Phase 4. The spirit
1. A campaign exists to a degree
2. Players can select their next destination which should have some effect on the next encounter
3. Players would do this indefinitely ('cause it's a fucking tech demo.)
4. Events will be read from the database
5. Npcs monster types will exist in a database
6. NPC monsters will be selected from the monster database to participate in 'campaign battles'
7. Campaign events can be progressed through cause and effect like choices that have a randomized variety.
